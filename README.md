# Orinoco-project
It was the fifth project from my developer's formation. I had to build the front side of a e-commerce application in JS Vanilla.

**How to see the project ?**
###

To use the application online, you have to clone the back-end side and follow the back-end readme instrcutions.

Then, when it's done and you have launched the back-end server, no need to use your localhost, you just can go to the application here : https://khalan1789.github.io/Orinoco-project/
